Hi there! My name is Jimmy (Junjie) Ma, and I am an incoming master’s student in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I previously completed my HBSc degree at the [University of Toronto Scarborough(UTSc)](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/), specializing in statistics with a focus on quantitative finance.

During my undergraduate studies at UTSc, I spent most of my time studying statistics and probability and their various applications. I also worked on [projects](https://jimmyma1006.github.io/projects/) involving the statistical analysis and visualization of clinical data. My goal is to utilize statistical tools to better understand the uncertainties in real life. As long as we persist in our statistical research, we will eventually arrive at the correct model, not just the useful one.

You can find my [CV](assets/Junjie_CV.pdf) here. I consider my life as a sub-martingale.
