## Brownian Motion and Potential Theory

In the Fall of 2023, I took a reading course(STAD93) with Professor [Ting-Kam Leonard Wong](https://tkl-wong.github.io/). In this course, we studied the connections between the Brownian Motion Process and Classical Potential Theory without the use of Ito's formula. In particular, we reviewed the probabilistic approaches to constructing the equilibrium measure and solving the Dirichelt and Poisson's problem.

We mainly followed the book "Green, Brown, and Probability & Brownian Motion on the Line" by Kai Lai Chung and enriched the details and proofs using "Lectures from Markov processes to Brownian motion" by Kai Lai Chung, "Brownian Motion" by Peter Morters and Yuval Peres, and "Probability and Stochastics" by Erhan Cinlar.

## Tuberculosis(TB) detection via Giant African Rats

In the Summer of 2023, I conducted a research project with Professor [Sohee Kang](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/sohee-kang) focusing on the TB diagnostic performance of Giant African Rats. In this project, we built an online application based on Shiny and various R packages capable of filtering, visualizing, and tracking the performance of teams of rats. A [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13HQGJQM-h1snqKF-OwME89MrlssLZHW7/view?usp=drive_link) of the App. We have published it, and you can access the [R Shiny App](https://1rsgc6-junjie-ma.shinyapps.io/Rats_Analysis/) here, but a password is needed. 

The most significant finding we achieved was the high sensitivity demonstrated by a group of rats in detecting TB, which often surpassed traditional methods. We finalized the optimal team by conducting a Bayesian analysis under the hierarchical model to evaluate how different combinations of rats perform. This is a short [presentation ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rLnwr87u92Mz6TfxCd0RHPCZQJYJOCek/view?usp=drive_link) that includes a description of the Bayesian model and posterior analysis.

## Risk Factors In Survival Of Patients With Malignant Melanoma

In the summer of 2023, we undertook a course project analyzing the survival time of malignant melanoma patients. Specifically, we applied various survival models, conducted model selection, and performed the corresponding inference. Our project was presented at the departmental research symposium.
