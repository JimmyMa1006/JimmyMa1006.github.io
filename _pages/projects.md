## Brownian Motion and Potential Theory

In Fall 2023, I took a reading course(STAD93) with Professor [Ting-Kam Leonard Wong](https://tkl-wong.github.io/). In this course, we studied the connections between Brownian Motion Process and Classical Potential Theory without the use of Ito's formula. In particular, we reviewed the probabilistic approaches to constructing the equilibrium measure and solving the Dirichelt and Poisson's problem.

We mainly followed the book "Green, Brown, and Probability & Brownian Motion on the Line" by Kai Lai Chung, and enriched the details and proofs using "Lectures from Markov processes to Brownian motion" by Kai Lai Chung, "Brownian Motion" by Peter Morters and Yuval Peres, and "Probability and Stochastics" by Erhan Cinlar.

## Tuberculosis(TB) detection via Giant African Rats

In Summer 2023, I conducted a research project with Professor Sohee Kang focusing on the TB diagnostic performance of Giant African Rats. In this project, we built a online application based on Shiny and various R packages capable of filtering, visualizing, and tracking the performance of teams of rats. You can access the [R Shiny App](https://1rsgc6-junjie-ma.shinyapps.io/Rats_Analysis/) here, but a password is needed.

![Shiny2](https://github.com/JimmyMa1006/JimmyMa1006.github.io/blob/8afdd9f4c53f53a76d873717c5bdb6dc5e7c90f0/images/Shiny2.png)


The most significant finding we achieved was the high sensitivity demonstrated by a group of rats in detecting TB, which often surpassed traditional methods. We finalized the optimal team by conducting a Bayesian analysis under the hierarchical model to evaluate how different combinations of rats perform. This is a short [presentation ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rLnwr87u92Mz6TfxCd0RHPCZQJYJOCek/view?usp=drive_link) that includes a description of the Bayesian model and posterior analysis.
