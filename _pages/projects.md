## Brownian Motion and Potential Theory

In Fall 2023, I took a reading course(STAD93) with Professor [Ting-Kam Leonard Wong](https://tkl-wong.github.io/). In this course, we studied the connections between Brownian Motion Process and Classical Potential Theory without the use of Ito's formula. In particular, we reviewed the probabilistic approaches to constructing the equilibrium measure and solving the Dirichelt and Poisson's problem.

We mainly followed the book "Green, Brown, and Probability & Brownian Motion on the Line" by Kai Lai Chung, and enriched the details and proofs using "Lectures from Markov processes to Brownian motion" by Kai Lai Chung, "Brownian Motion" by Peter Morters and Yuval Peres, and "Probability and Stochastics" by Erhan Cinlar.
