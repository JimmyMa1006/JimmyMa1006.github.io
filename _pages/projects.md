## Brownian Motion and Potential Theory

In Fall 2023, I took a reading course(STAD93) with Professor [Ting-Kam Leonard Wong](https://tkl-wong.github.io/). In this course, we explored the connections between Brownian Motion Process and Classical Potential Theory without the use of Ito's formula. In particular, we reviewed the probabilistic approaches to constructing the equilibrium measure and solveing Dirichelt and Poisson's problem.
